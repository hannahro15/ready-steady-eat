# Database Schema

Please see below a screenshot of a Database Schema for my models of my project which I created using Django-extensions and PygraphViz.

![Database Schema](documentation/models.png)

As you can see from the model above, my two custom models that I created were the contact form and the FAQ's, which are both within the contact app. Not all apps used models so I removed these off the Schema.

The technologies I used for creating the project were HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Python, Django, Bootstrap 4, AWS, Heroku, Github, Git, and the Stripe API.

1. On the home page, click 'New' and in the dropdown, click on 'Create a new app'.
2. Add app name (This name must be unique, and have all lower case letters. Also use minus/dash signs instead of spaces.)
3. Select Region (Select the most relevant region, mine is Europe)
4. Click the button that says 'Create App'.
5. Click on the Deploy tab near the top of the screen.
6. Where is says Deployment Method click on Github.
7. Below that, search for your repo name and add that.
8. Click connect to the app.

Before clicking below on enable automatic deployment do the following:

1. Click on the settings tab
2. Click on reveal config vars.
3. Add in your variables from your env. files as key value pairs. 
4. Go back and click on the Deploy tab.

Before the app can be connected, push the following new files below to the repository. Go back in the terminal in your coding environment and add the following:

1. git status
2. git add requirements.txt
3. git commit -m "Add requirements.txt file"
4. git add Procfile (web: gunicorn ready_steady_eat.wsgi:application)
5. git commit -m "Add Procfile"

Head back over to Heroku where the Deploy tab is.

Heroku will receive code from Github and build app with the required packages. Hopefully once done the 'App has successfully been deployed message below' will appear. 
3. Click 'View' to launch the new app. 
The deployed link of the app is https://ready-steady-eat-8febfd678f9f.herokuapp.com/
